            I am currently building performant and reusable components for
            mobile web applications at Apple using React, Javascript, HTML, and
            CSS. Over my time spent here, I've had the pleasure of working on a
            number of rewarding projects such as, building features for the
            Apple Watch Design Studio, a product that allows customers to pick
            and choose any Apple Watch case and band combination that they
            prefer.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my most memorable moments was having a product that I had
            been working on, the Discover tab in the native iOS Home app that
            helps customers find HomeKit enabled devices, be featured in{" "}
            <a href={"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2020/"}>
              Apple's 2020 October Keynote
            </a>{" "}
            event.

            Before my time at Apple, I was at USAA finding my way around in theÂ 
            <em>Valley of Docker and Infrastructure</em>. My team was
            responsible for being the gatekeepers of USAA's mystical API
            Gateways, and my job was to ensure that only the right people had
            access to the correct APIs within USAA. While I can say that the
            backend part of development isn't what particularly sparks my
            interests, I did gain a deeper understanding of how the internet
            functions and the protocols with which every request on the internet
            runs. Which in the end helped me understand how modern web
            applications run today.

            My passion for technology stems from an early age. My earliest
            memories are me figuring out how installation discs worked by the
            time I was eight years old and installing every game I could get my
            hands on. I have distinct memories of me staring at the MSN
            butterfly's translucent wings as they flapped up and down for what
            seemed like eons as I waited for our chunky HP to boot up.
          </p>
          <p>
            My love of design and building thoughtful intuitive interfaces can
            be attributed to my days when I would break open a MySpace or Tumblr
            themes or spend hours downloading addons and meticulously arranging
            my UI on World of Warcraft until I had what I believed to be the
            cleanest interface that had so many customizations to it that I
            couldn't even play on the out-of-the-box UI anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm in a constant pursuit to find a way to blend my passion for
            technology and my love of design, and I feel that Frontend
            development satisfies both of my passions in a way that nothing else
            has.

            If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read a
            short synopsis about me reflecting on my career and what has gotten
            me to this point.
